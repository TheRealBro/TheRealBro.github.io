# Day 1 - Saturday - 2018-03-03

## Coordinator

* We need to organize ourselves a bit different, with the loss of Lars.
* In general we don't want to have the role of "the Coordinator", as it is not really clear what the responsibilites should/would be
* We need people who take-over responsibility for several tasks, but we want to organize ourselves managed by our ticket system
* For special purposes - we can define single responsibilities for tasks, e.g.:
  * Organize off-site or other events [choose per event in Heroes Meeting]
  * Talk / coordinate with Release Management and Board [Per Jessen]
  * Hardware / Budget / Sponsoring [Thorsten Bro]
  * Interface-Function to SUSE-IT / MF-IT and SUSE-people in general [Theo Chatzimichos]
  * Heroes security (Sticking to coorporate SUSE / MF guidelines for security certification) [Christian Müller]
  * Onboarding / Guidance of new openSUSE Heroes (Help needed! Ask Theo!) [Theo Chatzimichos, Christian Müller]
      * We need an onboarding wiki page [Theo Chatzimichos]
  * In the Heroes meeting - Check the oldest tickets every month - to not loose track [everybody]

## General advice

### Subscribe to admin-auto@o.o mailing list with your account
### make you machines / services (root-accounts) sending mails to the above mentioned list

## Salt / Automation

* More configs / services
  * Formulas preferred
  * Static files / templates acceptable
* salt-master vs. monitoring machine lists are deviating
  * monitoring client configs should go to the "base" role so that all machines get basic monitoring
  * We need the packages / configs / services / NRPE / check_mk / etc.
  * Check the "deploy CM" doc and see what can be automated
* Webpage git repo -> push -> CI -> Reactor -> git pull on minion
  * GitHub repos cannot access gitlab-ci [bmwiedemann ask jdsn about mirroring git]
* Encrypted GPG Pillars
  * documentation [tchatzichmichos]
  * Missing script to re-encrypt all GPG pillars
* new services should always be configured with Salt!
* master in Provo (syndic)
